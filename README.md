Open Fashion App
This project is a React Native application that simulates a simple shopping cart. The app displays a list of products on the HomeScreen, allows users to add products to their cart, view the selected items in the CartScreen, and remove items from the cart.

Features
HomeScreen: Displays a list of available products with an "Add to Cart" button for each product.
CartScreen: Displays selected items with a "Remove from Cart" button for each item and the total price of the items in the cart.
Local Storage: Uses AsyncStorage to store selected items locally on the device.
